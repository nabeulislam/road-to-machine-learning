## Is ML the Right Solution?

### When to Use ML

✅ **Use ML when:**
- Problem is too complex for explicit rules
- Patterns exist but are hard to define
- Data is available and representative
- Problem requires adaptation to new patterns
- Solution needs to scale automatically

**Examples:**
- Image recognition
- Natural language understanding
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection

### When NOT to Use ML

❌ **Don't use ML when:**
- Simple rule-based solution works
- Data is insufficient or poor quality
- Problem requires 100% accuracy (safety-critical)
- Interpretability is legally required
- Solution is cheaper/faster with traditional methods

**Examples:**
- Simple calculations
- Well-defined business rules
- Deterministic processes

### Decision Framework

```
1. Can the problem be solved with simple rules?
   YES → Use traditional programming
   NO → Continue

2. Do we have sufficient, quality data?
   NO → Collect data first or use traditional methods
   YES → Continue

3. Do patterns exist in the data?
   NO → ML won't help
   YES → ML is appropriate

4. Will patterns change over time?
   NO → Traditional programming might be better
   YES → ML can adapt
```

## Problem Type Identification

### Step 1: Identify Output Type

**Question**: What are we trying to predict?

#### A. Continuous Value (Number)
→ **Regression Problem**

**Examples:**
- House price ($250,000)
- Temperature (72.5°F)
- Sales amount ($1,234.56)
- Time duration (3.5 hours)

**Characteristics:**
- Output is a real number
- Can be any value in a range
- Can perform arithmetic operations

#### B. Category/Class (Label)
→ **Classification Problem**

**Examples:**
- Email type (spam/not spam)
- Image category (cat/dog/bird)
- Disease diagnosis (healthy/sick)
- Customer segment (A/B/C)

**Characteristics:**
- Output is a discrete category
- Limited set of possible values
- Cannot perform arithmetic

#### C. No Clear Output (Pattern Discovery)
→ **Unsupervised Learning**

**Examples:**
- Customer groups (unknown)
- Anomalies in data
- Data structure discovery

**Characteristics:**
- No labels available
- Want to discover patterns
- Exploratory analysis

### Step 2: Check Data Availability

**Question**: Do we have labeled data?

#### Labeled Data Available
→ **Supervised Learning**
- Regression or Classification

#### No Labels Available
→ **Unsupervised Learning**
- Clustering or Dimensionality Reduction

#### Can Get Labels Through Interaction
→ **Reinforcement Learning**
- Agent learns from rewards
