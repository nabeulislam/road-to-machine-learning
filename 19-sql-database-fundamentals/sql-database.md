## Introduction to Databases

### What is a Database?

A database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. Think of it as a digital filing cabinet where data is stored in a structured format that makes it easy to find, update, and manage.

**Real-World Analogy:**
- **Spreadsheet**: Like a single table in a database
- **Database**: Like a collection of related spreadsheets (tables) with connections between them
- **DBMS**: The software that manages the database (like Excel manages spreadsheets)

**Why Databases?**
- **Data Persistence**: Store data permanently (unlike variables in memory)
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure data consistency and prevent errors
- **Efficient Access**: Fast retrieval and updates using indexes
- **Concurrent Access**: Multiple users can access data simultaneously
- **Security**: Access control and permissions to protect sensitive data
- **Scalability**: Handle large amounts of data efficiently
- **Relationships**: Connect related data across multiple tables

### Understanding Data Storage

**Without Database (File-based):**
```
customer_data.txt
order_data.txt
product_data.txt
```
Problems: No relationships, duplicate data, hard to query, no consistency

**With Database:**
```
customers table
orders table
products table
order_items table
```
Benefits: Relationships, no duplication, easy queries, data consistency

### Types of Databases

1. **Relational Databases (SQL)**
   - Structured data in tables
   - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite
   - Use SQL (Structured Query Language)

2. **NoSQL Databases**
   - Flexible schema
   - Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis
   - Different query languages

### Database Management System (DBMS)

Software that manages databases:
- **MySQL**: Popular open-source RDBMS
- **PostgreSQL**: Advanced open-source RDBMS
- **SQLite**: Lightweight, file-based
- **SQL Server**: Microsoft's RDBMS
- **Oracle**: Enterprise RDBMS

## Database Fundamentals

### Key Concepts

**Tables**: Collections of related data organized in rows and columns
**Rows (Records)**: Individual data entries
**Columns (Fields)**: Data attributes
**Primary Key**: Unique identifier for each row
**Foreign Key**: Reference to another table's primary key
**Index**: Improves query performance

### Database Relationships

Understanding relationships is crucial for database design. Relationships define how tables connect to each other.

#### 1. One-to-One (1:1)
One record in Table A relates to exactly one record in Table B.

**Example:**
- Each employee has exactly one employee profile
- Each user has exactly one login credential

```sql
-- Employee table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Employee profile table (one-to-one)
CREATE TABLE employee_profiles (
    profile_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id INT UNIQUE,  -- UNIQUE ensures one-to-one
    bio TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id)
);
```

**Visual:**
```
Employee 1 ──── Employee Profile 1
Employee 2 ──── Employee Profile 2
```

#### 2. One-to-Many (1:N)
One record in Table A relates to many records in Table B.

**Example:**
- One customer can have many orders
- One department can have many employees

```sql
-- Customers table (one)
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Orders table (many)
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,  -- Foreign key (many side)
    order_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);
```

**Visual:**
```
Customer 1 ──── Order 1
            └── Order 2
            └── Order 3
Customer 2 ──── Order 4
```

#### 3. Many-to-Many (M:N)
Many records in Table A relate to many records in Table B. Requires a junction table.

**Example:**
- Students can enroll in many courses
- Courses can have many students

```sql
-- Students table
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Courses table
CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Junction table (many-to-many)
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
    enrollment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    enrollment_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(course_id),
    UNIQUE(student_id, course_id)  -- Prevent duplicate enrollments
);
```

**Visual:**
```
Student 1 ──── Course 1
         └─── Course 2
Student 2 ──── Course 1
         └─── Course 3
```

### CRUD Operations

CRUD stands for the four basic operations you can perform on data:

- **Create**: INSERT data into tables
- **Read**: SELECT data from tables
- **Update**: UPDATE existing data
- **Delete**: DELETE data from tables

These operations form the foundation of all database interactions.

## SQL DDL Commands

DDL (Data Definition Language) - Define database structure.

### CREATE DATABASE

```sql
-- Create a new database
CREATE DATABASE company_db;

-- Use the database
USE company_db;
```

### CREATE TABLE

```sql
-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    hire_date DATE,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);
```

### Data Types

**Numeric:**
- `INT`: Integer
- `DECIMAL(p, s)`: Fixed-point number
- `FLOAT`: Floating-point number

**String:**

### ALTER TABLE

```sql
-- Add a column
ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR(20);

-- Modify a column
ALTER TABLE employees MODIFY COLUMN salary DECIMAL(12, 2);

-- Drop a column
ALTER TABLE employees DROP COLUMN phone;

-- Rename a column
ALTER TABLE employees RENAME COLUMN salary TO annual_salary;
```

### DROP TABLE

```sql
-- Drop a table
DROP TABLE employees;

INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, salary)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', '2024-01-15', 75000.00);

-- Insert multiple rows
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, salary)
VALUES 
    ('Jane', 'Smith', 'jane.smith@example.com', '2024-02-01', 80000.00),
    ('Bob', 'Johnson', 'bob.johnson@example.com', '2024-02-15', 70000.00);

-- Insert from another table
INSERT INTO employees_backup
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE hire_date < '2020-01-01';
```

### SELECT

-- Select all columns
SELECT * FROM employees;

-- Select specific columns
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees;

-- Select with alias
SELECT 
    first_name AS fname,
    last_name AS lname,
    salary AS annual_salary
FROM employees;

-- Select distinct values
SELECT DISTINCT department_id FROM employees;

-- Select with WHERE clause
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 70000;

-- Select with multiple conditions
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE salary > 70000 AND department_id = 1;

-- Select with IN
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE department_id IN (1, 2, 3);

SET salary = 80000 
WHERE employee_id = 1;

-- Update multiple columns
UPDATE employees 
SET salary = 85000, email = 'new.email@example.com'
WHERE employee_id = 1;

-- Update multiple rows
UPDATE employees 
SET salary = salary * 1.1 
WHERE department_id = 1;
```

### DELETE

```sql
-- Delete specific rows
DELETE FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 1;

-- Delete with condition
DELETE FROM employees WHERE salary < 50000;

-- Delete all rows (be careful!)

---

## SQL Joins

Joins combine data from multiple tables.

### INNER JOIN

Returns only matching rows from both tables.

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

### LEFT JOIN

Returns all rows from left table, matching rows from right table.

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

### RIGHT JOIN

Returns all rows from right table, matching rows from left table.

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

### FULL OUTER JOIN

Returns all rows from both tables (MySQL doesn't support, use UNION).

```sql
-- MySQL workaround
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
UNION
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

### CROSS JOIN

Cartesian product of both tables.

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
CROSS JOIN departments d;
```

### SELF JOIN

Join a table with itself.

```sql
-- Find employees and their managers
SELECT 
    e1.first_name AS employee,
    e2.first_name AS manager
FROM employees e1
LEFT JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;
```

---

## Subqueries

Queries within queries.

### Scalar Subquery

Returns single value.

```sql
-- Employees with salary above average
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

### Row Subquery

Returns single row.

```sql
-- Employee with highest salary
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE (salary, department_id) = (
    SELECT MAX(salary), department_id 
    FROM employees 
    GROUP BY department_id 
    LIMIT 1
);
```

### Column Subquery

Returns single column.

```sql
-- Employees in departments with more than 5 employees
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (
    SELECT department_id 
    FROM employees 
    GROUP BY department_id 
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
);
```

### Correlated Subquery

References outer query.

```sql
-- Employees with salary above department average
SELECT e1.* FROM employees e1
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary) 
    FROM employees e2 
    WHERE e2.department_id = e1.department_id
);
```

### EXISTS

Check if subquery returns any rows.

```sql
-- Departments with employees
SELECT * FROM departments d
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM employees e 
    WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
);
```

---

## Window Functions

Perform calculations across rows related to current row.

### ROW_NUMBER

Assigns sequential numbers.

```sql
SELECT 
    first_name,
    salary,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
FROM employees;
```

### RANK and DENSE_RANK

```sql
SELECT 
    first_name,
    salary,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dense_rank
FROM employees;
```

### PARTITION BY

Window functions with grouping.

```sql
-- Rank within each department
SELECT 
    first_name,
    department_id,
    salary,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dept_rank
FROM employees;
```

### LAG and LEAD

Access previous/next row.

```sql
SELECT 
    first_name,
    salary,
    LAG(salary, 1) OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS prev_salary,
    LEAD(salary, 1) OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS next_salary
FROM employees;
```

### Aggregate Window Functions

```sql
-- Running total
SELECT 
    first_name,
    salary,
    SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY employee_id) AS running_total
FROM employees;

-- Average by department
SELECT 
    first_name,
    department_id,
    salary,
    AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) AS dept_avg
FROM employees;
```

---

## Advanced SQL Topics

### Common Table Expressions (CTE)

Temporary named result set.

```sql
WITH high_earners AS (
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 80000
)
SELECT * FROM high_earners;
```

### Recursive CTE

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE manager_hierarchy AS (
    -- Base case
    SELECT employee_id, first_name, manager_id, 1 AS level
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive case
    SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.manager_id, mh.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN manager_hierarchy mh ON e.manager_id = mh.employee_id
)
SELECT * FROM manager_hierarchy;
```

### Views

Virtual tables based on query results.

```sql
-- Create view
CREATE VIEW employee_summary AS
SELECT 
    department_id,
    COUNT(*) AS employee_count,
    AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;

-- Use view
SELECT * FROM employee_summary;
```

### Stored Procedures

Reusable SQL code.

```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeByDepartment(IN dept_id INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = dept_id;
END //
DELIMITER ;

-- Call procedure
CALL GetEmployeeByDepartment(1);
```

## SQL with Python

### Using SQLite

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

# Connect to database
conn = sqlite3.connect('company.db')

# Run a query (sqlite3 lets you execute on the connection)
q = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")

# Fetch rows
results = q.fetchall()

# Using pandas
df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM employees", conn)

# Close connection
conn.close()
```

### Using SQLAlchemy

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd

# Create engine
engine = create_engine('mysql+pymysql://user:password@localhost/dbname')

# Read from database
df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM employees", engine)

# Write to database
df.to_sql('employees_backup', engine, if_exists='replace', index=False)
```

## Data Cleaning with SQL

SQL is powerful for data cleaning and preparation. Here are common techniques:

### Handling NULL Values

```sql
-- Check for NULL values
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE email IS NULL;

-- Replace NULL with default value
SELECT 
    first_name,
    COALESCE(email, 'no-email@example.com') AS email,
    COALESCE(salary, 0) AS salary
FROM employees;

-- Filter out NULL values
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE email IS NOT NULL;
```

### Removing Duplicates

```sql
-- Find duplicates
SELECT email, COUNT(*) as count
FROM employees
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Remove duplicates (keep one)
DELETE e1 FROM employees e1
INNER JOIN employees e2 
WHERE e1.employee_id > e2.employee_id 
AND e1.email = e2.email;

-- Or use DISTINCT
SELECT DISTINCT email FROM employees;
```

### String Cleaning

```sql
-- Trim whitespace
SELECT TRIM(first_name) FROM employees;

-- Remove special characters (MySQL)
SELECT REGEXP_REPLACE(email, '[^a-zA-Z0-9@.]', '') FROM employees;

-- Standardize case
SELECT UPPER(first_name), LOWER(email) FROM employees;

-- Extract substring
SELECT SUBSTRING(email, 1, LOCATE('@', email) - 1) AS username FROM employees;
```

### Data Type Conversion

```sql
-- Convert string to number
SELECT CAST('123' AS UNSIGNED) AS number;
SELECT CONVERT('123', UNSIGNED) AS number;

-- Convert number to string
SELECT CAST(salary AS CHAR) AS salary_str FROM employees;

-- Date conversion
SELECT STR_TO_DATE('2024-01-15', '%Y-%m-%d') AS date_value;
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(hire_date, '%Y-%m-%d') AS formatted_date FROM employees;
```

### Handling Outliers

```sql
-- Find outliers using IQR method
WITH stats AS (
    SELECT 
        AVG(salary) AS mean_salary,
        STDDEV(salary) AS std_salary
    FROM employees
)
SELECT * FROM employees, stats
WHERE salary < mean_salary - 3 * std_salary
   OR salary > mean_salary + 3 * std_salary;

-- Remove outliers
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT AVG(salary) - 3 * STDDEV(salary) FROM employees)
   OR salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) + 3 * STDDEV(salary) FROM employees);
```

### Data Validation

```sql
-- Validate email format (basic)
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE email NOT LIKE '%@%.%';

-- Validate date range
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE hire_date < '1900-01-01' OR hire_date > CURDATE();

-- Validate numeric range
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary < 0 OR salary > 1000000;
```

## Common Mistakes and Best Practices

### Common Mistakes

1. **Using SELECT *** in production
   ```sql
   -- Bad
   SELECT * FROM employees;
   
   -- Good
   SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name FROM employees;
   ```

2. **Not using WHERE with UPDATE/DELETE**
   ```sql
   -- Dangerous! Updates all rows
   UPDATE employees SET salary = 50000;
   
   -- Safe
   UPDATE employees SET salary = 50000 WHERE employee_id = 1;
   ```

3. **Ignoring NULL values**
   ```sql
   -- Wrong: NULL != NULL in SQL
   WHERE email = NULL;  -- Always false!
   
   -- Correct
   WHERE email IS NULL;
   ```

4. **Not using indexes on foreign keys**
   ```sql
   -- Always index foreign keys
   CREATE INDEX idx_department_id ON employees(department_id);
   ```

5. **Cartesian products (missing JOIN condition)**
   ```sql
   -- Bad: Creates cartesian product
   SELECT * FROM employees, departments;
   
   -- Good
   SELECT * FROM employees e
   JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
   ```

### Best Practices

1. **Use meaningful aliases**
   ```sql
   SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
   FROM employees e
   JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
   ```

2. **Format queries for readability**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       e.first_name,
       e.last_name,
       d.department_name,
       e.salary
   FROM employees e
   INNER JOIN departments d 
       ON e.department_id = d.department_id
   WHERE e.salary > 70000
   ORDER BY e.salary DESC;
   ```

3. **Use transactions for multiple operations**
   ```sql
   START TRANSACTION;
   UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
   UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;
   COMMIT;  -- Or ROLLBACK if error
   ```

4. **Use prepared statements (in applications)**
   ```python
   # Python example
   cur.execute("SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = %s", (emp_id,))
   ```

5. **Backup before major changes**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employees_backup AS SELECT * FROM employees;
   ```
