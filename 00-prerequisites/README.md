# Module 00: Prerequisites

Welcome to the foundation phase! Before diving into machine learning, we need to build a solid foundation in programming and mathematics.

##  What You'll Learn

- Python programming fundamentals
- **Linear Algebra**: Deep understanding of vectors, matrices, and transformations
- **Statistics & Probability**: Comprehensive coverage for model evaluation
- **Calculus**: Optimization and gradient descent for training models
- Setting up your development environment

##  Modules

### 01-python-basics
Learn Python from scratch—structured as **AI programming with Python**: core syntax, functional and object-oriented patterns, files, and exceptions before math-heavy ML topics.

**Topics:**
- Variables, operators, control flow, strings, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries; `import` and modules; `break` / `continue` / `pass`
- Functions and functional programming; `*args` / `**kwargs`; nested functions and scope
- Introduction to OOP: classes and objects; class and object theory; class and object implementation
- Iterators and generators (memory-efficient processing; connects to ML data pipelines); lambda functions; `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`
- File handling: text and binary I/O; read position with `tell` / `seek`; context managers (`with`); JSON and pickle (tradeoffs vs human-readable formats)
- Decorators; namespaces and the LEGB scope rule
- Inheritance and polymorphism; encapsulation and abstraction
- Practice problems based on file handling
- Exceptions: `try` / `except` / `else` / `finally`
- Tuples and other built-in types (as needed for data pipelines)
- Time complexity and algorithm efficiency (Big O notation)

**Capstone project:**
- **Movie script generator**. Apply files, strings, control flow, and optional OOP to build a small script-generation tool end to end. **Full runnable code** (CSV, `tell`/`seek`, `try`/`except`/`else`/`finally`) lives in [`01-python-basics.md` → Capstone: Movie script generator](01-python-basics.md#capstone-movie-script-generator).

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 weeks

**📖 [Complete Guide →](01-python-basics.md)**

**Additional Resources:**
- [DSA for ML Guide](../resources/dsa_for_ml_guide.md) - Essential data structures and algorithms specifically for machine learning
- [DSA Course (Python)](../resources/dsa_course_python.md) - Full beginner-to-interview DSA course (arrays, strings, trees, graphs, patterns)

### 02-linear-algebra

## Foundation exit criteria (before Module 01)

Do **not** start [Module 01](../01-python-for-data-science/README.md) until you can pass this gate. Weak foundations here are the main reason learners stall later.

| Skill | Self-check |
|-------|------------|
| Python | Write a function + class that reads a CSV and handles a missing-file error |
| Complexity | State Big-O of a single loop vs nested loop over *n* items |
