##  Topics Covered

### 1. Linear Regression
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Assumptions of Linear Regression
- Implementation with scikit-learn

### 2. Polynomial Regression
- When to use Polynomial Regression
- Overfitting concerns
- Implementation

### 3. Regularization
- **Ridge Regression (L2)**: Reduces overfitting by penalizing large coefficients
- **Lasso Regression (L1)**: Can eliminate features (feature selection)
- **Elastic Net**: Combines Ridge and Lasso

### 4. Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average squared difference
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Square root of MSE
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute difference
- **R² Score**: Proportion of variance explained
- **Adjusted R²**: R² adjusted for number of features

##  Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
- Implement linear and polynomial regression
- Understand how gradient descent works
- Apply regularization techniques (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net)
- Evaluate regression models using appropriate metrics
- Perform residual analysis and model diagnostics
- Handle outliers and multicollinearity
- Transform features for better performance
- Tune hyperparameters using cross-validation
- Build a complete regression project from scratch

##  Projects

1. **House Price Prediction**: Predict house prices using features like size, location, etc.
2. **Stock Price Prediction**: Predict stock prices (simplified version)
3. **Weather Prediction**: Predict temperature or rainfall

##  Key Concepts

- **Coefficients**: Weights learned by the model
- **Intercept**: Bias term
- **Residuals**: Difference between actual and predicted values
- **Multicollinearity**: High correlation between features
- **Feature Scaling**: Important for regularization
