# Phase 7: Feature Engineering

Learn to create and select the best features for your models.

##  What You'll Learn

- Feature Selection Techniques
- Feature Transformation
- Handling Categorical Variables
- Feature Scaling and Normalization
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
- Creating New Features

##  Topics Covered

### 1. Feature Selection
- **Filter Methods**: Statistical tests (Chi-square, correlation)
- **Wrapper Methods**: Forward/backward selection
- **Embedded Methods**: Lasso, tree-based importance
- **Removing Redundant Features**: Correlation analysis

### 2. Feature Transformation
- **Log Transformation**: Handle skewed distributions
- **Power Transformation**: Box-Cox transformation
- **Binning**: Convert continuous to categorical
- **Polynomial Features**: Create interaction terms

### 3. Categorical Variables
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Binary columns for each category
- **Label Encoding**: Numeric labels (for tree models)
- **Target Encoding**: Mean target per category
- **Frequency Encoding**: Count of category occurrences

### 4. Feature Scaling
- **Standardization**: Mean 0, Std 1 (Z-score)
- **Normalization**: Scale to [0, 1] range
- **Robust Scaling**: Using median and IQR
- **When to scale**: Required for distance-based algorithms

### 5. Dimensionality Reduction
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Linear dimensionality reduction
- **t-SNE**: Non-linear visualization
- **UMAP**: Modern alternative to t-SNE
- **When to use**: High-dimensional data, visualization

### 6. Creating Features
- **Domain Knowledge**: Industry-specific features
- **Temporal Features**: Time-based features
- **Interaction Features**: Combinations of features
- **Aggregation Features**: Group statistics

##  Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
- Select relevant features
- Transform features appropriately
- Handle categorical variables
- Apply dimensionality reduction
- Create domain-specific features

##  Projects

1. **Feature Engineering Challenge**: Improve model with better features
2. **PCA Visualization**: Visualize high-dimensional data
3. **Categorical Encoding Comparison**: Compare encoding methods

##  Key Concepts

- **Garbage In, Garbage Out**: Good features = good models
- **Domain Knowledge**: Often more valuable than algorithms
- **Feature Importance**: Understand which features matter
- **Curse of Dimensionality**: Too many features can hurt
