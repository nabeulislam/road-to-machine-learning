##  Project Structure

Each project should include:
```
project-name/
 README.md              # Project description and instructions
 data/                  # Dataset (or links to download)
 notebooks/             # Jupyter notebooks
    01-exploratory-data-analysis.ipynb
    02-data-preprocessing.ipynb
    03-model-training.ipynb
    04-model-evaluation.ipynb
 src/                   # Source code (if applicable)
 models/                # Saved models

```

##  Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic models, then improve
2. **Explore First**: Always do EDA before modeling
3. **Iterate**: Build, evaluate, improve, repeat
4. **Document**: Comment your code and explain decisions
5. **Visualize**: Create plots to understand data and results
6. **Compare**: Try multiple algorithms and compare results

##  Learning Outcomes

After completing these projects, you should be able to:
- Clean and preprocess real-world data
- Apply regression and classification algorithms
- Evaluate models appropriately
- Present results clearly
- Handle common data issues (missing values, outliers, etc.)
