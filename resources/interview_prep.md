## ML Concepts Questions

### Supervised Learning

**Q: What's the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?**

**Answer:**
- **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data to train models. The algorithm learns from input-output pairs.
  - Examples: Classification, Regression
  - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM
  
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Uses unlabeled data to find patterns.
  - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
  - Algorithms: K-Means, PCA, DBSCAN

**Q: Explain overfitting and how to prevent it.**

**Answer:**
Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise, and performs poorly on new data.

**Signs:**
- High training accuracy, low validation accuracy
- Large gap between train and test performance

**Prevention:**
1. **More Data**: Increase training dataset size
2. **Cross-Validation**: Use k-fold cross-validation
3. **Regularization**: L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge) regularization
4. **Early Stopping**: Stop training when validation loss stops improving
5. **Dropout**: For neural networks
6. **Feature Selection**: Remove irrelevant features
7. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models
8. **Simplify Model**: Reduce model complexity

**Q: What's the bias-variance tradeoff?**

**Answer:**
- **Bias**: Error from overly simplistic assumptions. High bias = underfitting
- **Variance**: Error from sensitivity to small fluctuations. High variance = overfitting
- **Tradeoff**: As model complexity increases, bias decreases but variance increases

**Optimal Point**: Balance between bias and variance for best generalization.

**Q: Explain cross-validation.**

**Answer:**
Cross-validation splits data into k folds, trains on k-1 folds, validates on remaining fold, repeats k times.

**Types:**
- **K-Fold**: Standard k-fold CV
- **Stratified K-Fold**: Maintains class distribution
- **Leave-One-Out**: k = n (each sample is a fold)
- **Time Series CV**: Respects temporal order

**Benefits:**
- Better use of data
- More reliable performance estimate
- Reduces overfitting risk

**Q: What's the difference between L1 and L2 regularization?**

**Answer:**

**L1 (Lasso):**
- Penalty: Sum of absolute values of coefficients
- Effect: Can reduce coefficients to exactly zero (feature selection)
- Use case: When you want feature selection
- Formula: λ * Σ|w_i|

**L2 (Ridge):**
- Penalty: Sum of squares of coefficients
- Effect: Shrinks coefficients toward zero but not exactly zero
- Use case: When you want to prevent overfitting
- Formula: λ * Σw_i²

**Elastic Net**: Combines both L1 and L2.

### Classification

**Q: Explain precision, recall, and F1-score.**

**Answer:**

**Precision**: Of all positive predictions, how many were correct?
- Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
- "When we predict positive, how often are we right?"

**Recall (Sensitivity)**: Of all actual positives, how many did we catch?
- Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
- "Of all positives, how many did we find?"

**F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- F1 = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
- Balances precision and recall

**When to use:**
- **High Precision**: When false positives are costly (e.g., spam detection)
- **High Recall**: When false negatives are costly (e.g., disease detection)
- **F1-Score**: When you need balance

**Q: What's ROC-AUC?**

**Answer:**
**ROC Curve**: Plots True Positive Rate (TPR) vs False Positive Rate (FPR) at different thresholds.

**AUC (Area Under Curve)**: Area under ROC curve.
- Range: 0 to 1
- 1.0 = Perfect classifier
- 0.5 = Random classifier
- <0.5 = Worse than random

**Interpretation**: Probability that model ranks random positive higher than random negative.

**Q: How do you handle imbalanced datasets?**

**Answer:**

**1. Resampling:**
- **Oversampling**: Duplicate minority class (SMOTE)
- **Undersampling**: Remove majority class samples

**2. Algorithm-level:**
- **Class weights**: Penalize misclassifying minority class
- **Threshold tuning**: Adjust decision threshold
- **Ensemble methods**: Use balanced sampling

**3. Evaluation:**
- Use appropriate metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC)
- Don't rely solely on accuracy

**4. Data:**
- Collect more minority class data
- Synthetic data generation

### Regression

**Q: Explain MSE, MAE, and R².**

**Answer:**

**MSE (Mean Squared Error)**:
- MSE = (1/n) * Σ(y_true - y_pred)²
- Penalizes large errors more
- Sensitive to outliers
- Units: squared units of target

**MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**:
- MAE = (1/n) * Σ|y_true - y_pred|
- Less sensitive to outliers
- Easier to interpret
- Units: same as target

**R² (Coefficient of Determination)**:
- R² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot)
- Proportion of variance explained
- Range: -∞ to 1 (1 = perfect, 0 = baseline, negative = worse than baseline)

**Q: What's the difference between linear and logistic regression?**

**Answer:**

**Linear Regression:**
- Output: Continuous values
- Use case: Predicting continuous targets
- Loss function: MSE
- Assumptions: Linear relationship, homoscedasticity, normality

**Logistic Regression:**
- Output: Probabilities (0 to 1)
- Use case: Binary classification
- Loss function: Log loss (cross-entropy)
- Uses sigmoid function to map to probabilities

### Ensemble Methods

**Q: Explain bagging vs boosting.**

**Answer:**

**Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)**:
- **Method**: Train multiple models independently on different subsets
- **Combination**: Average predictions (regression) or vote (classification)
- **Examples**: Random Forest
- **Reduces**: Variance
- **Parallel**: Models trained in parallel

**Boosting:**
- **Method**: Train models sequentially, each correcting previous errors
- **Combination**: Weighted combination
- **Examples**: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost
- **Reduces**: Bias
- **Sequential**: Models trained sequentially

**Q: How does Random Forest work?**

**Answer:**
1. Create multiple decision trees using bootstrap sampling
2. Each tree uses random subset of features (feature bagging)
3. Trees vote (classification) or average (regression)
4. Final prediction is majority vote or average

**Advantages:**
- Reduces overfitting
- Handles missing values
- Feature importance
- No feature scaling needed

### Neural Networks

**Q: Explain backpropagation.**

**Answer:**
Backpropagation is the algorithm for training neural networks.

**Process:**
1. **Forward Pass**: Input → Hidden → Output, calculate loss
2. **Backward Pass**: Calculate gradients using chain rule
3. **Update Weights**: Adjust weights using gradients and learning rate

**Key**: Chain rule of calculus allows efficient gradient computation.

**Q: What are activation functions and why are they needed?**

**Answer:**
Activation functions introduce non-linearity to neural networks.

**Common Functions:**
- **Sigmoid**: σ(x) = 1/(1+e^(-x)), range (0,1), suffers from vanishing gradient
- **Tanh**: Range (-1,1), better than sigmoid
- **ReLU**: f(x) = max(0,x), most common, solves vanishing gradient
- **Leaky ReLU**: f(x) = max(0.01x, x), fixes dying ReLU problem

**Why needed**: Without activation functions, neural network is just linear transformation, can't learn complex patterns.

**Q: Explain gradient descent variants.**

**Answer:**

**Batch Gradient Descent:**
- Uses entire dataset for each update
- Stable, but slow for large datasets

**Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):**
- Uses one sample per update
- Fast, but noisy updates

**Mini-batch Gradient Descent:**
- Uses small batch of samples
- Balance between speed and stability (most common)

**Optimizers:**
- **Adam**: Adaptive learning rate, most popular
- **RMSprop**: Adaptive learning rate
- **Momentum**: Reduces oscillations

## Coding Challenges

If you want a structured, beginner-friendly path for DSA (arrays → graphs + patterns + practice plan), see:

- [DSA Course (Python)](dsa_course_python.md)

### Common Coding Tasks

**1. Implement Linear Regression from Scratch**

```python
class LinearRegression:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate=0.01, iterations=1000):
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.iterations = iterations
        self.weights = None
        self.bias = None
    
    def fit(self, X, y):
        n_samples, n_features = X.shape
        self.weights = np.zeros(n_features)
        self.bias = 0
        
        for _ in range(self.iterations):
            y_pred = np.dot(X, self.weights) + self.bias
            dw = (1/n_samples) * np.dot(X.T, (y_pred - y))
            db = (1/n_samples) * np.sum(y_pred - y)
            
            self.weights -= self.learning_rate * dw
            self.bias -= self.learning_rate * db
    
    def predict(self, X):
        return np.dot(X, self.weights) + self.bias
```

**2. Calculate Confusion Matrix**

```python
def confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred):
    tp = sum((y_true == 1) & (y_pred == 1))
    tn = sum((y_true == 0) & (y_pred == 0))
    fp = sum((y_true == 0) & (y_pred == 1))
    fn = sum((y_true == 1) & (y_pred == 0))
    
    return np.array([[tn, fp],
                     [fn, tp]])
```

**3. Implement K-Means from Scratch**

```python
def kmeans(X, k, max_iters=100):
    # Initialize centroids randomly
    centroids = X[np.random.choice(X.shape[0], k, replace=False)]
    
    for _ in range(max_iters):
        # Assign clusters
        distances = np.sqrt(((X - centroids[:, np.newaxis])**2).sum(axis=2))
        labels = np.argmin(distances, axis=0)
        
        # Update centroids
        new_centroids = np.array([X[labels == i].mean(axis=0) 
                                  for i in range(k)])
        
        # Check convergence
        if np.all(centroids == new_centroids):
            break
        centroids = new_centroids
    
    return labels, centroids
```

**4. Feature Engineering with Pandas**

```python
# Handle missing values
df['age'].fillna(df['age'].median(), inplace=True)

# Encode categorical variables
df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['category'])

# Create new features
df['total_spent'] = df['quantity'] * df['price']
df['age_group'] = pd.cut(df['age'], bins=[0, 25, 50, 75, 100], 
                          labels=['Young', 'Adult', 'Senior', 'Elderly'])

# Normalize features
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
df[['feature1', 'feature2']] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['feature1', 'feature2']])
```
